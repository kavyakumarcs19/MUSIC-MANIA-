    <h1 style="text-align: center;">UNDER DEVELOPMENT  (Mobile music)</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Mobile music is music which is downloaded or streamed to mobile phones and played by mobile phones. Although many phones play music as ringtones, <br> true "music phones" generally allow users to stream music or download music files over the internet via a WiFi connection or 3G cell phone connection. Music phones are also able to import audio files from their PCs. <br> The case of mobile music being stored within the memory of the mobile phone is the case similar to traditional business models in the music industry. It supports two variants: the user can either purchase the music for outright ownership or access entire libraries of music via a subscription model. <br> In this case the music files are available as long as the subscription is active. </h2>
